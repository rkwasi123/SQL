--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--1 How many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?
SELECT count(DISTINCT orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order Id';

--2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order id';

--3  Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT 
   distinct c.acctnum
    , fs.orderiD
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN FebSales fs
ON c.order_id = fs.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID'; 

-- 4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?      
 SELECT 
     DISTINCT Product
     , min(price)
 FROM JanSales
 GROUP BY pRODUCT
 ORDER BY price ASC;
 
-- 5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

-- 6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT
    SUM(quantity)
    ,Product
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;      

-- 7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
 SELECT 
     COUNT(DISTINCT c.acctnum)
     , AVG(fs.Quantity*fs.price)
 FROM  FebSales fs
 LEFT JOIN customers c
 ON fs.orderID = c.order_id
 WHERE fs.Quantity>2
 AND length(orderid) = 6
 AND orderid <> 'orderID';
